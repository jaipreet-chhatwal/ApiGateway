## Define API Gateway
An API gateway is a server that acts as a “front-end” for an API. It receives requests, enforces policies and forwards appropriate requests to the service. By virtue of being a proxy it can provide functionality to support authentication, authorisation, security, audit and regularity compliance. It helps insulate the client from the implementation details, deal with versioning and reduce the number of requests / round-trips by aggregating queries. There’s a great description of the pattern here.https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html
